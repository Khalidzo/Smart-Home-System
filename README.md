# üè† Smart Home Project

This is my final project for my embedded systems diploma at AMIT Learning.
The diploma covered the core concepts of embedded systems and I've tried to apply these concepts in a practical project! :)
## System Requirements
These are the requirements to implement smart home application:
- Remoted controlled by mobile or laptop
- Login system including usernames and passwords
- Usernames and passwords must be kept in memory even if the system power is off
- If passwords are entered wrong more than 3 times, the system should fire up an alarm
#### Specifications -LCD
- LCD is used for login
- LCD must display the running devices in normal operation
- With every system action LCD must print a message

#### Specifications -EEPROM
- Storing new users to the system
#### Specifications -TTL/Bluetooth
- Transmitting/Receiving between the microcontroller and PC/mobile
- With every action a message must be printed on PC/mobile screen
- Transmitting/Receiving the commands to run the system
#### Specifications -Temperature Sensor, DC motor
- Temperature sensor reads the ambient temperatue, if the temperature exceeds 35 ¬∞C, the system should run the DC motor "Fan", if the temperature falls behind 30¬∞C, the DC motor must be turned off
#### Specifications -Door
- The actuator used is a servo motor to control the opening door
- The door opens up only if the user's password is entered correctly, it should remain closed otherwise

## Components used
- AVR ATMEGA32
- 16x2 LCD
- AT24C16A (16Kb EEPROM)
- DC motor
- Servo Motor SG-90
- Bluetooth module HC-05
- LM35 temperature sensor
- H-Bridge
- Buzzer

## Drivers Implemented
### LCD Driver
- Operation mode: 4 bit
### Temperature sesnor
- Utilizes MC's internal ADC for analog readings conversion
### UART
- Baudrate: 9600 bit/sec
- Operation mode: Interrupts for receiving and transmitting
- Used for serial communcations between MC and PC/mobile through bluetooth
### I2C
- Data transfer speed: 400KHz
- Single master single slave connection
- Used for communicating between MC and EEPROM for reading/writing operations
### ADC
- Speed: 125KHz
- Operation mode: Polling
### Bluetooth
- Implemented the UART communcation protocol for receiving and transmitting data
### DC Motor
- Connected to the H-Bridge and operating on full speed
### Servo Motor
- Used PWM (Fast PWM mode) for operation
